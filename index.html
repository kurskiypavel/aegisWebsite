            <p style="font-size: 32px;line-height: 32px;font-family: GT-Alpina-Standard-Light,sans-serif;">Aegis is a boutique design agency that builds deeper relationships between organizations and people. Experience has taught us that the best design comes from the bottom up. ⬤ As anthropologists, we start on the ground, ask a lot of questions and observe carefully. As designers, we collectively draw on expertise in social science, anthropology, journalism and story-telling. ⬤ No two projects are the same but our conviction remains: the real answers are more likely to be found in the field than in the boardroom.</p>

                <p style="font-family: GT-Alpina-Standard-Light,sans-serif ;font-size: 21px;line-height: 25px;">We’ve found that the most daunting organizational problems are best solved by examining  cultural context: the messy web of material constraints, habits, social relationships, needs, and values that inform what people believe and why they do the things they do. Grounding our design practice in a deeper ability to interpret culture leads to more impactful results for our clients.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 23px">The best communications succeed not just because they’re clever or beautiful, but because they make a genuine connection with their audience.

                                <p>— An outside perspective combined with attentive and thorough research gets to the heart of even the most complex value proposition, then shares it in accessible, differentiating terms.

                        <p>Rather than trying to be all things to all people, successful organizations focus on what makes them incomparable. We will identify your organization’s uniqueness and work with you to ensure that those qualities are reflected in your decision-making and operational structure.</p>

In our experience, this lateral, interactive approach helps build stronger consensus than top-down mandates.</p>
