                    boutique design agency that builds deeper relationships between organizations and people. Experience has
                    taught us that the best design comes from the bottom up. ⬤ As anthropologists, we start on the ground,
                    ask a lot of questions and observe carefully. As designers, we collectively draw on expertise in social
                    science, anthropology, journalism and story-telling. ⬤ No two projects are the same but our conviction
                    remains: the real answers are more likely to be found in the field than in the boardroom.</p>

                                the messy web of material constraints, habits, social relationships, needs, and values that inform
                                what people believe and why they do the things they do. Grounding our design practice in a deeper

                    taught us that the best design comes from the bottom up. ⬤ As anthropologists, we start on the ground,
                    ask a lot of questions and observe carefully. As designers, we collectively draw on expertise in social
                    science, anthropology, journalism and story-telling. ⬤ No two projects are the same but our conviction
                    remains: the real answers are more likely to be found in the field than in the boardroom.</p>

                        what people believe and why they do the things they do. Grounding our design practice in a deeper
                        ability to interpret culture leads to more impactful results for our clients.</p>
